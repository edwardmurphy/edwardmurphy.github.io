		<p>One of my current programming hobbies (long since "in the works" but really just "in the brain") is collecting and refactoring all of my R code and writing the same code in Python. The main purpose of refactoring my R code is to introduce myself to new libraries and functions in R, while also cleaning up code I wrote at the beginning of my R coding career. By rewriting these R scripts in Python, I can interactively and practically learn a new language. </p>
<p>I'll be updating this post or creating new posts as progress is made, but for now the R code has been collected as is viewable in GitHub. The plan is to create a new repo for refactored R scripts and yet another repo for the corresponding Python scripts. I'll likely use IPython/Jupyter for the Python scripts to track my notes as I learn. I don't know if R code can be embedded in Jupyter notebooks, but if it can then perhaps I can save a step. </p>
<p>Thanks for reading.

<p>UPDATE: Yep, R can be run in Jupyter. Fun. There are at least 2 ways to run R in Jupyter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run R "natively" using the R Kernal in Jupyter</li>
<li>Run R within the Python kernel using the rpy2 package</li>
</ol>
<h2>R Kernel</h2>
<p>To run R natively in Jupyter, <a href="http://irkernel.github.io/installation">IRkernel</a> needs to be installed. I had a whale of a time installing the required dependency packages in R due to missing libraries (most notably libcurl and libcurl-openssl-devel). Within openSUSE Leap 42.1 I wasn't even able to locate the latter package within Yast. A Google search for the rpm file did the trick though. Oh, and gcc-c++ was needed as well for compilation. Also, install_github didn't work at somet point. Had to use install_git instead.</p>
<h2>R within Python Kernel</h2>
<p>To do this, the <strong>rpy2</strong> package needs to be installed. I had all sorts of compilation issues using <strong>pip</strong> to install this, so I installed using the package manager (zypper in SUSE).</p>
<p>Once installed, <a href="https://edwardmurphy.github.io/self-intro-to-jupyter-notebooks.html">open up a Jupyter notebook</a> and run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">%load_ext</span> <span class="n">rpy2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ipython</span>
</pre></div>


<p>That's it! R code can then be run using the R-magic command: prepend \%R before code. </p>
