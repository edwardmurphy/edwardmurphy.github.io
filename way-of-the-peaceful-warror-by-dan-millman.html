<p>Review: Although there were certainly a few gem quotes, I couldn't escape the feeling that this was just the 
re-hashing of an LSD trip. The author seems very coy about the truth of the story, which bugs me. Are you saying this 
depth of consciousness is truly possible (flying over the Earth in your mind?) or is it a metaphor? I didn't like the 
middle ground tease that the book presents. I'm in if the author really believes this happened (no matter how many 
drugs he had to take to get there). If it's just a metaphor, well...I have a much more important book that gets me in 
a state of awareness. Not knowing which it was ended my journey early with this book. I just didn't want to feel like 
a fool.</p>
<p>Some good quotes:</p>
<p>"Use whatever knowledge you have but see its limitations. Knowledge alone does not suffice; it has no heart. No amount 
of knowledge will nourish or sustain your spirit; it can never bring you ultimate happiness or peace. Life requires 
more than knowledge; it requires intense feeling and constant energy. Life demands <em>right action</em> if knowledge is to 
come alive." -pg. 19</p>
<p>"The warrior acts...and the fool only reacts." -pg. 20</p>
<p>"When you become fully responsible for your life, you can become fully human; once you become human, you may discover 
what it means to be a warrior." -pgs. 28-29</p>
<p>"The world was peopled with minds, whirling faster than any wind, in search of distraction and escape from the 
predicament of change, the dilemma of life and death - seeking purpose, security, enjoyment, trying to make sense of 
the mystery. Everyone everywhere lived a confused, bitter search. Reality never matched their dreams; happiness was 
just around the corner - a corner they never turned. And the source of it all was the human mind." -pg. 42</p>
