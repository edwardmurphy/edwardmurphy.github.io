    <h1 class="entry-title">About</h1>
    
    <p>B.S., Neuroscience (Phi Beta Kappa) from the University of Pittsburgh. </p>
<p>M.S., Statistics from San Diego State University.</p>
<p>Completed all the course work for a Ph.D. in Computational Science from Claremont Graduate University and San Diego 
State University, but stalled on the research part. Perhaps again one day...</p>
<p>Biostatistician, Statistical Programmer, Quality Engineer, Data Analyst, Biochemist with 15 years experience in the biotech industry. </p>
<p>Born and raised in Delaware County, PA (adjacent to Philadelphia), with a few years in Ocean City, NJ where my love of the ocean was 
fully developed. Moved slightly west for college at the University of Pittsburgh. Moved further west after graduation to the city I now 
call home - San Diego, CA. Local status achieved.</p>
<p>Played lacrosse in high school and college. In my junior year of college we played for the national championship in 
collegiate club level lacrosse. We lost to Penn State. I scored a goal in a national championship game, says my inner 
Al Bundy. </p>
<p>Father of an amazing son who has taught me to keep growing. I do have a guardian angel - her Earth name is Sarah.</p>
<p>Hobbies include bodysurfing, reading, computer networking and software, computer programming, math anything, playing 
dominoes, and dancing. Rocking a beard and a chain on my wallet since before the hipsters.  </p>
<p>No longer a big sports fan, but I am in love with Kawhi Leonard and not afraid to say it. Complete package of work 
ethic, drive, and humility. It was an honor to watch him play in college. </p>
<p>Whatchamacallit is my go-to candy bar. </p>
