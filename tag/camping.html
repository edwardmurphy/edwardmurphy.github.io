</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I went car camping in Big Sur in September of this year. It was my first time in that part of Norcal, and I loved every moment of it. My tent was set up adjacent to the Big Sur River, so each morning I'd open the tent fly and I'd immediately see the low rocky river and bed. What a way to start the day. The weather was mixed. My campground seemed to the be the only place that got any sun in the area. High temps there were mid-60s. Everywhere else I visited was cloudy with temps in the 50s. Night time temps were 40s. </p>
<p>This is about what I expected prior to departure, and before packing I made a list of clothing items to bring. Afterwards I realized that the list was really successful, i.e. I used nearly all of the items and didn't miss anything I absolutely needed. Figured I would share this list for future reference. This is handy for a 4 day car camping trip where events in/with civilization are included: nothing fancy but having clean, presentable clothing is desired.</p>
