		<p>At some point I may get around to an article describing how/why I run multiple Linux distros across my various 
gadgets/hardware, but if I waited to write this article then frankly I'd stall. So, it'll have to suffice that 
multiple posts of mine will simply refer to this as yet unwritten article. </p>
<p>For now, I'd like to jot some notes concerning how I've evaluated distros in the past, as much as I can recall them 
from memory, and also to delineate planned benchmarks. All of the items I'm now posting have been scattered in my 
brain over a fairly long stretch of time, so it is mighty fulfilling to capture them more concisely and spatially. 
Perhaps the following conditions/features can be scripted one day for quick reporting in tabular form...maybe even 
wrrapped into some more tinkering with databases for data capture - a skill that I'd enjoy learning. Ahhh, reference 
to another article. </p>
<p>Here are some stock feature of Linux distros that I've previously jotted down as worthy of consideration for 
evaluation. Most of these features are customizable, so most are not show-stoppers. However, since I've found that the 
main difference among distros is the suite of stock packages included with the Linux kernel, these features rather 
define a distro from the beginning, so in the end they can make or break a distro for me. After all, if I simply 
wanted to pick ALL my own packages, I'd just start with Arch. Who has time...</p>
<ul>
<li>Terminal</li>
<li>File Explorer (especially network discovery, including Samba shares)</li>
<li>Document Viewer</li>
<li>Test Editor</li>
<li>Image Editor</li>
<li>BitTorrent Client</li>
<li>E-mail</li>
<li>Video Player</li>
<li>Package Manager</li>
</ul>
<p>The choice of display manager is inexorably tied to the features above for most distros, and I've found that I usually 
prefer bits and pieces from different display managers (e.g. Gnome, Cinnamon, etc.). For instance, my favorite 
terminal is yakuake. However, installation of yakuake comes at a price - installation of dozens and dozens of KDE 
packages I simply do not use. Thie could belie inexperience on my part (i.e. knowing how to not install recommended 
but unrequired packages), but what I wind up with is bloatware to the max. As I test and/or evaluate these features 
more formally across distros, I'll take some more time to see if installation of new packages is loaded with 
unncessary software. </p>
<p>Here are some additional considerations which I'll most leave here for future description and amendment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Expertise level assumed (i.e. does the distro assume I need to be protected from myself?)</li>
<li>R: ease of installation of packages (i.e. are paths available to R or, as in above, as I assumed to need protection 
from myself?)</li>
<li>Chroot-ability: any issue chrooting into other filesystems?</li>
<li>GUI system configuration (related to package management). I don't want to be protected from myself, but I also don't 
really know how to configure the system in /etc for most settings, so leave me alone but come here...that's a totally 
reasonable attitude, right?</li>
<li>Overall speed. Plasma 5 just simply DOES NOT WORK (except in CentOS, I've found). openSUSE seems to be faster than 
Linux Mint. Stuff like this. </li>
</ul>
